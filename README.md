Objective
This assignment investigates a comparative performance study of several clustering algorithms, applied to the "Air Quality" dataset obtained from the UCI repository. The primary objective is to explore and evaluate the performance of clustering algorithms including KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, and MeanShift, with a focus on different preprocessing techniques such as normalization and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Dataset
The dataset utilized for this assignment is the Air Quality dataset, which can be accessed from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

Air Quality Dataset

Methods Employed
Clustering Algorithms:

K-Means

Hierarchical Clustering

MeanShift

Preprocessing Techniques:

Normalization (StandardScaler)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Evaluation Metrics:

Silhouette Score

Calinski-Harabasz Index

Davies-Bouldin Index

Clustering Results
This section summarizes the performance of different clustering algorithms, tested with various preprocessing techniques. The results were evaluated across multiple metrics, indicating the overall effectiveness of each method.

Best Clustering Results:
Silhouette Score: 0.811844

Calinski-Harabasz Index: 7676.529163

Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.310482

Optimal Number of Clusters: 3

Applied Preprocessing: Normalization

Best Clustering Algorithm: MeanShift

Results and Analysis
The clustering performance was evaluated using the following three algorithms, each with different preprocessing techniques:

Silhouette Score: Measures the similarity of points within the same cluster relative to points in other clusters. Higher scores signify better-defined clusters.

Calinski-Harabasz Index: The ratio of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion. A higher score indicates a better separation between clusters.

Davies-Bouldin Index: Evaluates the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar neighbor. A lower score signifies more distinct clusters.

Conclusion
The MeanShift algorithm, when coupled with normalization preprocessing, demonstrated the best performance on the Air Quality dataset. This method achieved a Silhouette score of 0.811844 and a Davies-Bouldin score of 0.310482, with an optimal clustering result of 3 clusters.

The results indicate that MeanShift was particularly effective in identifying well-separated clusters, reflecting variations in air quality data across different regions.
